# Cross identifications with Tycho-2 catalogue

Tool *gen_tycho2* generates cross identifications between Tycho-2 and PPM/DM catalogues. Designation are for DM (BD/SD/CD) and other old catalogues. In the case of PPM stars, DM designation are taken from their DM column. In north hemisfere, also BD stars (from -1 to +19) are used. In south hemisfere, also CD stars are used. However, designations for GC (Cat√°logo General Argentino), OA (Oeltzen-Argelander catalogue) and G (Gilliss catalogue) are prioritized due to its higher precision.

Since all identifications are performed just by angular distance thresholds, misidentifications might happen.

Before executing *gen_tycho2*, download Tycho-2 catalog from VizieR (I/259) and concatenate data files into a single *cat/tyc2.txt* file.

Files in this folder:
- cross_tyc2_north.csv = Cross identifications of Tycho-2 stars (northern hemisfere)
- cross_tyc2_south.csv = Cross identifications of Tycho-2 stars (southern hemisfere)
- plotann.py = Modified Python script (part of Astrometry.net software) that replaces Tycho-2 stars by those generated in the CSV files

In order to use plotann.py, replace it. Then, copy the CSV files here to the target folder where plotann.py will be used. Finally, use plotann with Tycho2 catalogue, e.g.
    plotann.py image.wcs image.png image.ann.png --no-grid --no-const --tycho2cat=tycho2.kd

Example:
![Alt text](image.ann.png?raw=true "Southern Pleyades")
